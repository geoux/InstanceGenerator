# InstanceGenerator
Developed with Netbeans 8.0.1, JDK 8.

To generate the instances open a terminal in the folder dist and just run the folling command:
java -jar InstanceGenerator.jar

Instances can be found in the folder src/instnces. You can find here two sets where the first one correspond to a concave function of the cost depending of the capacity. Set 2 correspond to the concave function of the cost but with a random value to make it independent of the capacity.
